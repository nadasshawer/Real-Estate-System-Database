# Real-Estate-System-Database

Skills: 🗃️ Database Design · 🧠 ERD · 💾 SQL · 🛠️ Data Normalization · 🗺️ Entity Relationship Mapping

For my Database I university course, I collaborated with a team to design and implement a relational database for real estate management using Microsoft SQL Server, creating an ERD schema to model property listings, agents, clients, and transactions. The database supports queries for tracking sales, commissions, and client interactions. We wrote optimized SQL scripts for data manipulation, reporting, and integrity constraints. This project strengthened my skills in database design, normalization, and SQL programming, demonstrating my ability to build efficient, scalable data solutions for real-world business needs.
